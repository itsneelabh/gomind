## 🎯 What Is This and Why Should You Care?

Let me explain this with a real-world analogy.

### The Restaurant Order Analogy

Imagine you're a waiter in a busy restaurant, and you need to place orders with the kitchen. The kitchen has many different stations:
- **The Grill** (needs: protein type, doneness, temperature)
- **The Salad Station** (needs: greens type, dressing, toppings)
- **The Dessert Bar** (needs: dessert name, portion size, add-ons)

Now, imagine three scenarios:

**Scenario 1 (Phase 1):** You get a note that says "Make something with chicken" - you have to guess what the grill needs.

**Scenario 2 (Phase 2):** You get a form with labeled blanks: "Protein: ______, Doneness: ______, Temperature: ______" - much easier!

**Scenario 3 (Phase 3):** The kitchen checks your filled form before cooking to make sure everything is valid - prevents mistakes!

**That's exactly what GoMind's 3-Phase approach does for AI agents!** It helps AI generate the right JSON payloads for tool calls, with progressive levels of guidance and validation.

### Why This Matters

When building AI agents that orchestrate tools, one critical challenge emerges:

**How does an AI agent know what JSON data to send to a tool?**

Consider this scenario:
```go
// Agent discovers a weather tool
tools := agent.DiscoverTools(ctx)

// Agent needs to call it for user request: "weather in London"
// What JSON should it send?
payload := ??? // {"location": "London"}? {"city": "London"}? {"place": "London"}?
```

Without guidance, the AI must guess field names, types, and structure. This leads to:
- ❌ Wrong field names (`city` vs `location`)
- ❌ Wrong types (string vs number)
- ❌ Missing required fields
- ❌ Unexpected extra fields
- ❌ Failed tool calls and poor user experience

**GoMind solves this with a 3-phase progressive enhancement approach.**

## 🔍 The Problem We're Solving

Before we dive into the solution, let's understand the constraints and challenges:

### The Challenge: Scale and Efficiency

In a typical GoMind deployment:
- **50-100 tools** × **3-5 capabilities each** = **150-500 total capabilities**
- Each capability needs payload metadata for AI generation
- AI has limited context window (~100k tokens)
- Network latency in K8s clusters (~2-5ms per call)
- Tools register capabilities in Redis for discovery

### The Questions We Need to Answer

1. **For Tool Selection:** How does the AI know which tool to use?
   - Answer: Natural language descriptions (Phase 1)

2. **For Payload Generation:** How does the AI know what fields to include?
   - Answer: Field hints with types and examples (Phase 2)

3. **For Validation:** How do we ensure the generated payload is correct?
   - Answer: JSON Schema validation with caching (Phase 3)

### Key Insights from 2025 LLM Research

Research in 2025 has significantly advanced our understanding of LLMs and structured outputs:

**SchemaBench Study (February 2025):** A comprehensive benchmark with ~40,000 JSON schemas revealed that while LLMs have improved, they still struggle with valid JSON generation without proper guidance. However, studies show that **descriptions and field hints remain the most effective mechanism for AI generation**, with reinforcement learning enhancing schema understanding.

**OpenAI's Structured Output Breakthrough:** The introduction of "strict mode" achieved **100% compliance** with JSON schemas (compared to just 35% with prompting alone), validating the critical insight:

> **"For LLMs interacting with schemas, descriptions are potent instructions and a fundamental part of the implicit prompt the model receives."**

**Industry Evolution:** Tools like Outlines, Transformers-cfg, and LLM 0.23 (February 2025) now provide grammar-constrained generation and schema support, but the fundamental principle remains:

**Implication:** AI generates best from *rich descriptions* and *field hints*, not from reading raw JSON Schemas. Schemas are for **validation**, not **generation**.

This 2025 research validates our 3-phase approach:
- **Phase 1 & 2:** Descriptions and hints for AI generation (what LLMs excel at)
- **Phase 3:** Full schemas for validation (ensuring 100% compliance)

## 🚀 The Solution: 3-Phase Progressive Enhancement

GoMind uses a **progressive enhancement** approach - each phase builds on the previous one, and you can stop at any phase based on your needs.

### Overview: The Three Phases

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 3: Schema-Based Validation (OPTIONAL)            │
│ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │
│ • Validates AI-generated payloads before sending       │
│ • Only if GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS=true                │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How They Work Together

**Think of it like building a house:**

- **Phase 1** = Foundation (everyone has it, always present)
- **Phase 2** = Walls and roof (recommended for most homes)
- **Phase 3** = Security system (optional, for high-value homes)

**You don't choose one phase - they stack!** Each phase enhances the previous:

```go
// Phase 1: AI reads description
"Gets current weather for a location. Required: location (city name)."
↓
// Phase 2: AI sees structured hints
RequiredFields: [{Name: "location", Type: "string", Example: "London"}]
↓
// Phase 3: Generated payload is validated
Validate({"location": "London"}) → ✓ Valid
```

## 📝 Phase 1: Description-Based Generation (Always Present)

Phase 1 is the **foundation** of the 3-phase approach. Every tool capability MUST have a good description.

### What Is Phase 1?

Phase 1 uses **natural language descriptions** to help AI understand:
- What the capability does
- What inputs it expects
- What outputs it provides

### Why Phase 1 Alone Works Pretty Well

Modern LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) are surprisingly good at inferring structure from descriptions. Research shows ~85-90% accuracy with well-written descriptions.

The key: **Descriptions are "implicit prompts"** that guide AI generation.

### How to Write Great Phase 1 Descriptions

A good description follows this formula:

```
[Action] [what it does]. Required: [required fields]. Optional: [optional fields with defaults].
```

**Examples:**

✅ **Good Description:**
```go
Description: "Gets current weather conditions for a location. " +
             "Required: location (city name). " +
             "Optional: units (metric/imperial, default: metric)."
```

❌ **Poor Description:**
```go
Description: "Weather API"  // Too vague!
```

✅ **Good Description:**
```go
Description: "Analyzes historical weather patterns. " +
             "Required: location (city name), start_date, end_date (YYYY-MM-DD format). " +
             "Optional: include_trends (boolean, default: false)."
```

### Tool Implementation - Phase 1

Here's how to implement Phase 1 in your tool:

```go
package main

import "github.com/itsneelabh/gomind/core"

func main() {
    // Create a tool
    tool := core.NewTool("weather-service")

    // Register capability with Phase 1 description
    tool.RegisterCapability(core.Capability{
        Name: "current_weather",

        // Phase 1: Clear, structured description
        Description: "Gets current weather conditions for a location. " +
                     "Required: location (city name or coordinates). " +
                     "Optional: units (metric/imperial, default: metric), " +
                     "include_forecast (boolean, default: false).",

        InputTypes:  []string{"json"},
        OutputTypes: []string{"json"},
        Handler:     handleWeather,
    })

    // Start the tool
    tool.Start(8080)
}

func handleWeather(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Your handler logic here
}
```

### Agent Usage - Phase 1

When an agent discovers tools, it automatically gets Phase 1 descriptions:

```go
// Agent discovers all tools
tools := agent.DiscoverTools(ctx)

// Returns capabilities with descriptions:
// {
//   "name": "current_weather",
//   "description": "Gets current weather conditions for a location. Required: location (city name)..."
// }

// Agent sends description to AI for payload generation
prompt := fmt.Sprintf(`Generate JSON payload for tool: %s
Description: %s
User request: %s`, capability.Name, capability.Description, userRequest)

// AI generates: {"location": "London", "units": "metric"}
```

### When Phase 1 Alone Is Enough

Phase 1 is sufficient for:
- ✅ **Prototypes and MVPs** - Get started fast
- ✅ **Simple tools with 1-2 fields** - Descriptions work well
- ✅ **Internal tools with relaxed validation** - ~85-90% accuracy is fine
- ✅ **Tools with flexible input formats** - Don't need exact field names

## 🎯 Phase 2: Field-Hint-Based Generation (Recommended)

Phase 2 adds **structured field hints** to guide AI more precisely. This is the **recommended approach** for production tools.

### What Is Phase 2?

Phase 2 provides the AI with:
- **Exact field names** (no guessing: `location` not `city`)
- **Field types** (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`)
- **Examples** (showing valid values)
- **Field descriptions** (what each field means)
- **Required vs Optional** (which fields must be included)

### Why Phase 2 Improves Accuracy

With Phase 2, AI doesn't need to infer field names - it gets them explicitly:

```
Phase 1: "Required: location (city name)"
         → AI guesses: "location"? "city"? "place"? "cityName"?

Phase 2: {Name: "location", Type: "string", Example: "London"}
         → AI knows exactly: "location" (no guessing!)
```

This boosts accuracy from ~85-90% to **~95%**.

### The SchemaSummary and FieldHint Structs

Phase 2 uses two simple structs:

```go
// FieldHint provides basic field information for AI-powered payload generation
type FieldHint struct {
    Name        string `json:"name"`                  // Field name (e.g., "location")
    Type        string `json:"type"`                  // JSON type: "string", "number", "boolean", "object", "array"
    Example     string `json:"example,omitempty"`     // Example value (e.g., "London")
    Description string `json:"description,omitempty"` // Human-readable description
}

// SchemaSummary provides compact schema hints for the registry
type SchemaSummary struct {
    RequiredFields []FieldHint `json:"required,omitempty"` // Fields that must be provided
    OptionalFields []FieldHint `json:"optional,omitempty"` // Fields that are optional
}
```

### Tool Implementation - Phase 2

Here's how to add Phase 2 to your tool (builds on Phase 1):

```go
package main

import "github.com/itsneelabh/gomind/core"

func main() {
    tool := core.NewTool("weather-service")

    // Register capability with Phase 1 + Phase 2
    tool.RegisterCapability(core.Capability{
        Name: "current_weather",

        // Phase 1: Still include description (fallback + human-readable)
        Description: "Gets current weather conditions for a location.",

        InputTypes:  []string{"json"},
        OutputTypes: []string{"json"},
        Handler:     handleWeather,

        // Phase 2: Add structured field hints
        InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
            RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
                {
                    Name:        "location",
                    Type:        "string",
                    Example:     "London",
                    Description: "City name or coordinates (lat,lon)",
                },
            },
            OptionalFields: []core.FieldHint{
                {
                    Name:        "units",
                    Type:        "string",
                    Example:     "metric",
                    Description: "Temperature unit: metric or imperial",
                },
                {
                    Name:        "include_forecast",
                    Type:        "boolean",
                    Example:     "false",
                    Description: "Include 7-day forecast in response",
                },
            },
        },
    })

    tool.Start(8080)
}
```

### Agent Usage - Phase 2

Agents automatically use Phase 2 hints if available:

```go
// Agent discovers tools with Phase 2 hints
capability := tool.GetCapabilities()[0]

// Check if Phase 2 hints are available
if capability.InputSummary != nil {
    // Build Phase 2 prompt with field hints
    prompt := buildPhase2Prompt(userRequest, capability)
    // Prompt includes exact field names, types, examples
} else {
    // Fall back to Phase 1 (description only)
    prompt := buildPhase1Prompt(userRequest, capability)
}

// AI generates payload with correct field names
payload := aiClient.GeneratePayload(ctx, prompt)
// Returns: {"location": "London", "units": "metric"}
```

### Phase 2 Prompt Example

Here's what the AI receives with Phase 2:

```
Generate a JSON payload for calling a tool capability.

Tool Capability: current_weather
Description: Gets current weather conditions for a location.

Required fields:
  - location (string): City name or coordinates (lat,lon) [example: London]

Optional fields:
  - units (string): Temperature unit: metric or imperial [example: metric]
  - include_forecast (boolean): Include 7-day forecast in response [example: false]

User Request: What's the weather in Tokyo?

Generate ONLY a valid JSON object using the exact field names shown above.
```

**AI generates:**
```json
{
  "location": "Tokyo",
  "units": "metric"
}
```

### Size Impact - Phase 2

Phase 2 adds minimal overhead to service discovery:

```
Phase 1 only: ~100-200 bytes per capability
Phase 2 added: ~200-300 bytes per capability
Total: ~300-500 bytes per capability

For 500 capabilities:
  Phase 1 only: ~100KB total
  Phase 1 + 2:  ~150-250KB total

Still fits easily in:
  - Single Redis call
  - AI context window
  - K8s network (2-5ms latency)
```

### When to Use Phase 2

Use Phase 2 for:
- ✅ **Production tools** - 95% accuracy matters
- ✅ **Tools with 3+ fields** - Field hints eliminate ambiguity
- ✅ **Public APIs** - Clear contract for external consumers
- ✅ **Tools with strict field names** - No room for guessing
- ✅ **Tools with complex types** - Objects, arrays need type hints

## 🔒 Phase 3: Schema-Based Validation (Optional)

Phase 3 adds **full JSON Schema validation** before sending payloads to tools. This is **optional** and meant for high-reliability scenarios.

### What Is Phase 3?

Phase 3:
- Fetches full JSON Schema from tool's `/schema` endpoint
- Validates AI-generated payloads against the schema
- Caches schemas in Redis (shared across agent replicas)
- Only runs if `GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS=true` environment variable is set

### Why Phase 3 Is Optional

Phase 2 already gives 95% accuracy. Phase 3 adds validation to catch the remaining 5% of edge cases:
- Wrong types (string instead of number)
- Values outside allowed enums
- Missing required fields
- Extra disallowed fields
- Pattern/format violations

**Trade-off:** Phase 3 adds ~2-5ms latency on first call (schema fetch), then 0ms after (cached).

### The Schema Cache Architecture

Phase 3 uses a Redis-backed cache shared across all agent replicas:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ RedisSchemaCache (Production Implementation)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Redis Cache                                            │
│ - Shared across all agent replicas                     │
│ - ~1-2ms latency in K8s                                │
│ - 24-hour TTL (configurable)                           │
│ - Automatic key namespacing (gomind:schema:)           │
│ - Thread-safe operations (atomic counters)             │
│ - Built-in statistics (hits, misses, hit rate)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tool Implementation - Phase 3

Tools don't need to do anything special - the framework **auto-generates** schema endpoints:

```go
// Tool registers capability with Phase 2 hints
tool.RegisterCapability(core.Capability{
    Name: "current_weather",
    Description: "Gets current weather conditions for a location.",
    InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
        RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
            {Name: "location", Type: "string", Example: "London"},
        },
        // ...
    },
    Handler: handleWeather,
})

// Framework automatically creates schema endpoint:
// GET /api/capabilities/current_weather/schema
//
// Returns full JSON Schema v7 auto-generated from InputSummary:
// {
//   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
//   "type": "object",
//   "properties": {
//     "location": {"type": "string", "description": "..."}
//   },
//   "required": ["location"],
//   "additionalProperties": false
// }
```

If you want a custom schema, implement the `/schema` endpoint yourself:

```go
// Custom schema endpoint (advanced)
tool.mux.HandleFunc("/api/capabilities/current_weather/schema", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    schema := map[string]interface{}{
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": map[string]interface{}{
            "location": map[string]interface{}{
                "type": "string",
                "minLength": 1,
                "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z ]+$|^-?\\d+\\.\\d+,-?\\d+\\.\\d+$",
                "description": "City name or coordinates",
            },
            "units": map[string]interface{}{
                "type": "string",
                "enum": []string{"metric", "imperial"},
                "default": "metric",
            },
        },
        "required": []string{"location"},
        "additionalProperties": false,
    }
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(schema)
})
```

### Agent Implementation - Phase 3

Agents enable Phase 3 by:

1. **Setting up Redis schema cache** (shared across replicas)
2. **Setting environment variable** `GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS=true`

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "os"
    "time"

    "github.com/go-redis/redis/v8"
    "github.com/itsneelabh/gomind/core"
)

func main() {
    // Create agent
    agent, err := NewResearchAgent()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create agent: %v", err)
    }

    // Phase 3 Setup: Initialize schema cache with Redis
    if redisURL := os.Getenv("REDIS_URL"); redisURL != "" {
        redisOpt, err := redis.ParseURL(redisURL)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("⚠️  Warning: Failed to parse REDIS_URL: %v", err)
            log.Println("   Schema caching will be disabled")
        } else {
            redisClient := redis.NewClient(redisOpt)

            // Test connection
            ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
            defer cancel()

            if err := redisClient.Ping(ctx).Err(); err != nil {
                log.Printf("⚠️  Warning: Redis connection failed: %v", err)
                log.Println("   Schema caching will be disabled")
                redisClient.Close()
            } else {
                // Enable schema cache (default configuration)
                agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient)
                log.Println("✅ Schema cache initialized with Redis backend")

                // Or customize with options:
                // agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
                //     core.WithTTL(1 * time.Hour),        // Custom TTL
                //     core.WithPrefix("myapp:schemas:"),  // Custom prefix
                // )
            }
        }
    } else {
        log.Println("ℹ️  Schema caching disabled (no REDIS_URL)")
    }

    // Start agent
    agent.Start(8090)
}
```

### Agent Validation Logic - Phase 3

Here's how agents use Phase 3 validation:

```go
func (a *Agent) callTool(ctx context.Context, tool *core.ServiceInfo, capability core.Capability, userRequest string) error {
    // Phase 1 + 2: Generate payload with AI
    payload, err := a.generatePayloadWithAI(ctx, userRequest, capability)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("payload generation failed: %w", err)
    }

    // Phase 3: Validate payload (only if enabled)
    if os.Getenv("GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS") == "true" {
        schema, err := a.fetchSchemaIfNeeded(ctx, tool, &capability)
        if err != nil {
            // Log warning but don't fail - validation is optional
            a.Logger.Warn("Schema fetch failed, proceeding without validation", map[string]interface{}{
                "tool":  tool.Name,
                "error": err.Error(),
            })
        } else {
            // Validate generated payload
            if err := a.validatePayload(payload, schema); err != nil {
                return fmt.Errorf("payload validation failed: %w", err)
            }

        }
    }

    // For production, use a full JSON Schema validator:
    // import "github.com/xeipuuv/gojsonschema"

    return nil
}
```

### Environment Variables - Phase 3

```bash
# Enable Phase 3 validation (disabled by default)
export GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS=true

# Redis URL for schema cache (required for Phase 3)
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Schema Cache Options

The schema cache supports customization via options:

```go
// Default configuration (24-hour TTL, "gomind:schema:" prefix)
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient)

// Custom TTL (shorter if schemas change frequently)
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithTTL(1 * time.Hour),
)

// Custom prefix (multi-tenant deployments)
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithPrefix("tenant-abc:schema:"),
)

// Both customizations
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithTTL(6 * time.Hour),
    core.WithPrefix("prod:schemas:"),
)
```

### Schema Cache Statistics

Monitor cache performance with built-in stats:

```go
// Get cache statistics
if agent.SchemaCache != nil {
    stats := agent.SchemaCache.Stats()
    // Returns:
    // {
    //   "hits": 1295,
    //   "misses": 105,
    //   "total_lookups": 1400,
    //   "hit_rate": 0.925
    // }

    log.Printf("Schema cache stats: %+v", stats)
}
```

### When to Use Phase 3

Enable Phase 3 for:
- ✅ **High-reliability systems** - Every payload must be correct
- ✅ **Financial/healthcare tools** - Errors have real consequences
- ✅ **New tool integrations** - Validate untested tools
- ✅ **Strict compliance requirements** - Need proof of validation
- ✅ **Development/testing** - Catch payload errors early

Skip Phase 3 for:
- ❌ **Performance-critical paths** - Save ~5ms on first call
- ❌ **Mature, stable tools** - 95% accuracy is sufficient
- ❌ **High-volume, low-stakes operations** - Volume > perfection

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide for Tool Developers

This section is your step-by-step guide to implementing the 3-phase approach in your tools.

### Step 1: Write a Great Description (Phase 1)

Every capability needs a clear, structured description:

```go
tool.RegisterCapability(core.Capability{
    Name: "search_products",

    // Phase 1: Follow the formula
    Description: "Searches product catalog by keyword. " +
                 "Required: query (search term). " +
                 "Optional: category (filter by category), " +
                 "max_results (default: 10), " +
                 "sort_by (relevance/price/rating, default: relevance).",

    Handler: handleProductSearch,
})
```

**Formula:** `[Action] [what]. Required: [fields]. Optional: [fields with defaults].`

### Step 2: Add Field Hints (Phase 2)

Add `InputSummary` with structured field hints:

```go
tool.RegisterCapability(core.Capability{
    Name: "search_products",
    Description: "Searches product catalog by keyword.",
    Handler: handleProductSearch,

    // Phase 2: Add field hints
    InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
        RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
            {
                Name:        "query",
                Type:        "string",
                Example:     "wireless headphones",
                Description: "Search term to find products",
            },
        },
        OptionalFields: []core.FieldHint{
            {
                Name:        "category",
                Type:        "string",
                Example:     "electronics",
                Description: "Filter results by category",
            },
            {
                Name:        "max_results",
                Type:        "number",
                Example:     "10",
                Description: "Maximum number of results to return (1-100)",
            },
            {
                Name:        "sort_by",
                Type:        "string",
                Example:     "relevance",
                Description: "Sort order: relevance, price, or rating",
            },
        },
    },
})
```

### Step 3: Test Your Tool

Test that AI can generate correct payloads:

```go
// Test Phase 1 (description only)
// Agent should infer: {"query": "..."}

// Test Phase 2 (with hints)
// Agent should generate: {"query": "...", "category": "...", "max_results": 10}
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Custom Schema Endpoint (Phase 3)

If you need custom validation rules, implement a schema endpoint:

```go
tool.mux.HandleFunc("/api/capabilities/search_products/schema", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    schema := map[string]interface{}{
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": map[string]interface{}{
            "query": map[string]interface{}{
                "type": "string",
                "minLength": 1,
                "maxLength": 200,
            },
            "category": map[string]interface{}{
                "type": "string",
                "enum": []string{"electronics", "clothing", "books", "home"},
            },
            "max_results": map[string]interface{}{
                "type": "number",
                "minimum": 1,
                "maximum": 100,
                "default": 10,
            },
            "sort_by": map[string]interface{}{
                "type": "string",
                "enum": []string{"relevance", "price", "rating"},
                "default": "relevance",
            },
        },
        "required": []string{"query"},
        "additionalProperties": false,
    }

    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(schema)
})
```

### Complete Tool Example

    // Current weather capability with all 3 phases
    w.RegisterCapability(core.Capability{
        Name: "current_weather",

        // Phase 1: Clear description
        Description: "Gets current weather conditions for a location. " +
                     "Required: location (city name). " +
                     "Optional: units (metric/imperial, default: metric).",

        InputTypes:  []string{"json"},
        OutputTypes: []string{"json"},
        Handler:     w.handleCurrentWeather,

        // Phase 2: Field hints
        InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
            RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
                {
                    Name:        "location",
                    Type:        "string",
                    Example:     "London",
                    Description: "City name or coordinates (lat,lon)",
                },
            },
            OptionalFields: []core.FieldHint{
                {
                    Name:        "units",
                    Type:        "string",
                    Example:     "metric",
                    Description: "Temperature unit: metric or imperial",
                },
            },
        },
        // Phase 3: Schema endpoint auto-generated by framework
    })
}

func (w *WeatherTool) handleCurrentWeather(writer http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req struct {
        Location string `json:"location"`
        Units    string `json:"units"`
    }

    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {
        http.Error(writer, "Invalid request", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    // Default units
    if req.Units == "" {

    }
}
```

## 🤖 Implementation Guide for Agent Developers

This section guides you through implementing the 3-phase approach in your AI agents.

### Step 1: Basic Agent Setup

Create your agent structure:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/itsneelabh/gomind/core"
)

type ResearchAgent struct {
    *core.BaseAgent
    aiClient   core.AIClient
    httpClient *http.Client
}

func NewResearchAgent() (*ResearchAgent, error) {
    agent := &ResearchAgent{
        BaseAgent:  core.NewBaseAgent("research-agent"),
        httpClient: &http.Client{Timeout: 30 * time.Second},
    }

    // Initialize AI client (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    aiClient, err := core.NewOpenAIClient(
        os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        "gpt-4",
    )
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    agent.aiClient = aiClient

    return agent, nil
}
```

### Step 2: Tool Discovery

Discover tools and their capabilities:

```go
func (a *ResearchAgent) researchTopic(ctx context.Context, topic string) (string, error) {
    // Discover all available tools (gets Phase 1 + Phase 2 data)
    tools, err := a.DiscoverTools(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("tool discovery failed: %w", err)
    }

    // Each tool has capabilities with:
    // - Phase 1: Description
    // - Phase 2: InputSummary (if provided)

    a.Logger.Info("Discovered tools", map[string]interface{}{
        "count": len(tools),
    })

    return a.orchestrateResearch(ctx, topic, tools)
}
```

### Step 3: AI Payload Generation (Phase 1 + 2)

Generate payloads using AI with automatic phase selection:

```go
func (a *ResearchAgent) generatePayloadWithAI(ctx context.Context, userRequest string, capability *core.Capability) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
    var prompt string

    // Automatic phase selection
    if capability.InputSummary != nil {
        // Phase 2: Use field hints (95% accuracy)
        prompt = a.buildPhase2Prompt(userRequest, capability)
        a.Logger.Debug("Using Phase 2 payload generation", map[string]interface{}{
            "capability": capability.Name,
        })
    } else {
        // Phase 1: Fall back to description (85-90% accuracy)
        prompt = a.buildPhase1Prompt(userRequest, capability)
        a.Logger.Debug("Using Phase 1 payload generation", map[string]interface{}{
            "capability": capability.Name,
        })
    }

    // Generate payload with AI
    response, err := a.aiClient.GenerateResponse(ctx, prompt, &core.AIOptions{
        Temperature: 0.1, // Low temperature for consistent output
        MaxTokens:   500,
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("AI generation failed: %w", err)
    }

    // Parse JSON response
    var payload map[string]interface{}
    content := strings.TrimSpace(response.Content)

    // Strip markdown code blocks if present
    if strings.HasPrefix(content, "```") {
        content = a.stripCodeBlocks(content)
    }

    if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(content), &payload); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse AI payload: %w", err)
    }

    return payload, nil
}

// Phase 1 prompt builder
func (a *ResearchAgent) buildPhase1Prompt(userRequest string, capability *core.Capability) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf(`You are a JSON payload generator for tool APIs.

Tool Capability: %s
Description: %s

User Request: %s

Generate ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):`,
        capability.Name, capability.Description, userRequest)
}

// Phase 2 prompt builder
func (a *ResearchAgent) buildPhase2Prompt(userRequest string, capability *core.Capability) string {
    prompt := fmt.Sprintf(`Generate a JSON payload for calling a tool capability.

Tool Capability: %s
Description: %s

Required fields:
`, capability.Name, capability.Description)

    for _, field := range capability.InputSummary.RequiredFields {
        prompt += fmt.Sprintf("  - %s (%s): %s", field.Name, field.Type, field.Description)
        if field.Example != "" {
            prompt += fmt.Sprintf(" [example: %s]", field.Example)
        }
        prompt += "\n"
    }

    if len(capability.InputSummary.OptionalFields) > 0 {
        prompt += "\nOptional fields:\n"
        for _, field := range capability.InputSummary.OptionalFields {
            prompt += fmt.Sprintf("  - %s (%s): %s", field.Name, field.Type, field.Description)
            if field.Example != "" {
                prompt += fmt.Sprintf(" [example: %s]", field.Example)
            }
            prompt += "\n"
        }
    }

    prompt += fmt.Sprintf(`
User Request: %s

Generate ONLY a valid JSON object using the exact field names shown above:`, userRequest)

    return prompt
}
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Enable Phase 3 Validation

Initialize schema cache in `main.go`:

```go
func main() {
    agent, err := NewResearchAgent()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create agent: %v", err)
    }

    // Phase 3: Initialize schema cache
    if redisURL := os.Getenv("REDIS_URL"); redisURL != "" {
        redisOpt, err := redis.ParseURL(redisURL)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("⚠️  Warning: Failed to parse REDIS_URL: %v", err)
        } else {
            redisClient := redis.NewClient(redisOpt)

            ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
            defer cancel()

            if err := redisClient.Ping(ctx).Err(); err != nil {
                log.Printf("⚠️  Warning: Redis connection failed: %v", err)
                redisClient.Close()
            } else {
                agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient)
                log.Println("✅ Schema cache initialized")
            }
        }
    }

    // Start agent
    if err := agent.Start(8090); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to start agent: %v", err)
    }
}
```

Add validation to tool calling logic:

```go
func (a *ResearchAgent) callTool(ctx context.Context, tool *core.ServiceInfo, capability core.Capability, userRequest string) (*ToolResult, error) {
    startTime := time.Now()

    // Phase 1 + 2: Generate payload
    payload, err := a.generatePayloadWithAI(ctx, userRequest, &capability)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("payload generation failed: %w", err)
    }

    // Phase 3: Optional validation
    if os.Getenv("GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS") == "true" {
        schema, err := a.fetchSchemaIfNeeded(ctx, tool, &capability)
        if err != nil {
            a.Logger.Warn("Schema fetch failed, proceeding without validation", map[string]interface{}{
                "error": err.Error(),
            })
        } else {
            if err := a.validatePayload(payload, schema); err != nil {
                return nil, fmt.Errorf("payload validation failed: %w", err)
            }
            a.Logger.Info("Payload validated successfully")
        }
    }

    // Call tool
    return a.sendPayloadToTool(ctx, tool, capability, payload)
}
```

Total Time Breakdown:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Step 1: Discovery         ~5ms
Step 2: Tool Selection    ~1000ms (AI)
Step 3: Payload Gen       ~1000ms (AI)
Step 4: Validation        ~5ms (first call) / ~0ms (cached)
Step 5: Tool Call         ~100ms
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL:                    ~2110ms

Bottleneck: AI calls (Steps 2 & 3) = ~2000ms
Schema overhead: ~5ms first call, 0ms after (negligible)
```

### Key Observations

1. **AI dominates latency** (~2000ms) - schema operations are negligible (~5ms)
2. **Discovery is efficient** - Single Redis call gets 500 capabilities in ~5ms
3. **Phase 2 data is small** - ~200-300 bytes per capability, fits in discovery response
4. **Phase 3 caching works** - 0ms overhead after first schema fetch
5. **Validation is optional** - Can skip Phase 3 entirely for performance

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Latency Breakdown by Phase

```
Phase 1 (Description):
  Discovery: 2-5ms (Redis)
  AI Generation: 500-2000ms
  Total: ~500-2000ms

Phase 2 (Field Hints):
  Discovery: 2-5ms (Redis, includes hints)
  AI Generation: 500-2000ms
  Total: ~500-2000ms

Phase 3 (Validation):
  First call: +2-5ms (schema fetch + cache)
  Subsequent: +0ms (cached in Redis)
  Validation: <1ms (in-memory check)
  Total: +2-5ms (one-time), then +0ms

Combined (All 3 Phases):
  First call: ~505-2010ms
  Subsequent: ~500-2000ms (0ms schema overhead)
```

### Memory Impact

```
Registry Size (500 capabilities):
  Phase 1 only: ~100KB
  Phase 1 + 2:  ~150-250KB
  Phase 3:      Not in registry (fetched on-demand)

Redis Schema Cache (500 capabilities):
  Storage: ~500KB-1MB (full schemas)
  Shared across: All agent replicas
  TTL: 24 hours (configurable)

Per-Agent Memory (without Phase 3):
  No schema storage needed

Per-Agent Memory (with Phase 3 + Redis cache):
  Minimal (schemas in Redis, not agent memory)
```

### Accuracy Improvements

```
Phase 1 (Description-Based):
  Accuracy: ~85-90%
  Good for: Simple tools, 1-2 fields

Phase 2 (Field-Hint-Based):
  Accuracy: ~95%
  Improvement: +5-10% over Phase 1
  Good for: Production tools, 3+ fields

Phase 3 (Schema Validation):
  Accuracy: ~99%
  Improvement: +4% over Phase 2 (catches edge cases)
  Good for: Mission-critical, high-reliability systems
```

### Network Calls Per Request

```
Without Phase 3:
  1. Discovery (Redis): 1 call
  2. AI Generation: 2-3 calls
  3. Tool Call: 1 call
  Total: 4-5 network calls

With Phase 3 (First Call):
  1. Discovery (Redis): 1 call
  2. AI Generation: 2-3 calls
  3. Schema Fetch (HTTP): 1 call
  4. Schema Cache (Redis): 1 write
  5. Tool Call: 1 call
  Total: 6-8 network calls

With Phase 3 (Cached):
  Same as without Phase 3 (schema in cache)
  Total: 4-5 network calls
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Tool Developers

#### 1. Always Write Clear Descriptions (Phase 1)

✅ **Do:**
```go
Description: "Searches product catalog by keyword. " +
             "Required: query (search term). " +
             "Optional: category (electronics/books/clothing), max_results (default: 10)."
```

❌ **Don't:**
```go
Description: "Product search API"  // Too vague!
```

#### 2. Add Field Hints for Production Tools (Phase 2)

✅ **Do:**
```go
InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
    RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
        {
            Name:        "query",
            Type:        "string",
            Example:     "laptop",
            Description: "Search term for products",
        },
    },
    // ...
}
```

❌ **Don't:**
```go
// Skipping Phase 2 for production tools with 3+ fields
```

#### 3. Use Consistent Field Types

✅ **Do:**
```go
{Name: "max_results", Type: "number", Example: "10"}
{Name: "include_details", Type: "boolean", Example: "true"}
{Name: "filters", Type: "object", Example: "{}"}
```

❌ **Don't:**
```go
{Name: "max_results", Type: "string", Example: "ten"}  // Should be number!
```

#### 4. Provide Helpful Examples

✅ **Do:**
```go
{
    Name:    "date_range",
    Type:    "string",
    Example: "2024-01-01:2024-01-31",  // Shows format!
}
```

❌ **Don't:**
```go
{
    Name:    "date_range",
    Type:    "string",
    Example: "...",  // Not helpful!
}
```

### For Agent Developers

#### 1. Enable Phase 3 for High-Reliability Systems

```go
// Development: Always enable for early error detection
export GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS=true

// Production: Enable for critical paths
if isCriticalOperation {
    os.Setenv("GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS", "true")
}
```

#### 2. Monitor Schema Cache Performance

```go
// Log cache stats periodically
go func() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(5 * time.Minute)
    for range ticker.C {
        if agent.SchemaCache != nil {
            stats := agent.SchemaCache.Stats()
            agent.Logger.Info("Schema cache stats", stats)

            // Alert on low hit rate
            if hitRate, ok := stats["hit_rate"].(float64); ok && hitRate < 0.8 {
                agent.Logger.Warn("Low schema cache hit rate", map[string]interface{}{
                    "hit_rate": hitRate,
                })
            }
        }
    }
}()
```

#### 3. Handle Validation Failures Gracefully

```go
// Don't fail hard on validation errors
if err := validatePayload(payload, schema); err != nil {
    agent.Logger.Error("Validation failed", map[string]interface{}{
        "payload": payload,
        "error":   err.Error(),
    })

    // Option 1: Retry with AI (maybe AI made a mistake)
    payload, err = retryPayloadGeneration(ctx, capability)

    // Option 2: Use default values
    payload = applyDefaults(payload, schema)

    // Option 3: Skip this tool, try another
    return tryAlternativeTool(ctx, userRequest)
}
```

#### 4. Set Appropriate Cache TTLs

```go
// Schemas rarely change - use long TTL
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithTTL(24 * time.Hour),  // Default, good for most cases
)

// If schemas change frequently (development)
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithTTL(1 * time.Hour),  // Shorter TTL
)

// If schemas never change (stable APIs)
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithTTL(7 * 24 * time.Hour),  // Week-long TTL
)
```

### General Best Practices

#### 1. Start Simple, Add Complexity

```
Week 1: Phase 1 (descriptions) - Get it working
Week 2: Phase 2 (field hints) - Improve accuracy
Week 3: Phase 3 (validation) - Add for critical paths
```

#### 2. Use Phase 3 Selectively

```go
// Enable validation only for critical operations
func (a *Agent) callTool(ctx context.Context, tool *core.ServiceInfo, capability core.Capability, userRequest string) error {
    payload, err := a.generatePayload(ctx, userRequest, capability)

    // Validate only high-stakes operations
    if isHighStakes(capability.Name) {
        schema, _ := a.fetchSchema(ctx, tool, capability)
        if err := a.validatePayload(payload, schema); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }

    return a.sendToTool(ctx, tool, capability, payload)
}
```

#### 3. Document Your Capabilities

```go
// Add comments explaining your tool's behavior
tool.RegisterCapability(core.Capability{
    Name: "complex_analysis",

    // Phase 1: Be explicit about format requirements
    Description: "Analyzes financial data. " +
                 "Required: stock_symbol (uppercase ticker), date_range (YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD). " +
                 "Optional: indicators (array of: RSI/MACD/SMA).",

    // Phase 2: Show exact format in examples
    InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
        RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
            {
                Name:    "date_range",
                Type:    "string",
                Example: "2024-01-01:2024-01-31",  // Format is clear!
            },
        },
    },
})
```

## 🔧 Common Patterns and Solutions

### Pattern 1: Complex Nested Objects

For tools with nested object inputs:

```go
// Phase 2 hints can describe objects
InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
    RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
        {
            Name:        "filter",
            Type:        "object",
            Example:     `{"category": "electronics", "price_range": {"min": 100, "max": 500}}`,
            Description: "Filter criteria with category and optional price_range",
        },
    },
}
```

**AI will generate:**
```json
{
  "filter": {
    "category": "electronics",
    "price_range": {"min": 100, "max": 500}
  }
}
```

### Pattern 2: Array Inputs

For tools accepting arrays:

```go
InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
    RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
        {
            Name:        "stock_symbols",
            Type:        "array",
            Example:     `["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT"]`,
            Description: "List of stock ticker symbols (uppercase)",
        },
    },
}
```

### Pattern 3: Enum Values

For fields with restricted values:

```go
InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
    OptionalFields: []core.FieldHint{
        {
            Name:        "sort_order",
            Type:        "string",
            Example:     "asc",
            Description: "Sort order: 'asc' or 'desc'",  // AI learns valid values
        },
    },
}

// Phase 3 schema enforces it:
schema := map[string]interface{}{
    "properties": map[string]interface{}{
        "sort_order": map[string]interface{}{
            "type": "string",
            "enum": []string{"asc", "desc"},
        },
    },
}
```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Tenant Schema Caching

For multi-tenant deployments:

```go
// Separate cache per tenant
tenantID := getTenantID(ctx)
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithPrefix(fmt.Sprintf("tenant-%s:schema:", tenantID)),
)
```

### Pattern 5: Conditional Validation

Enable validation based on environment:

```go
func (a *Agent) callTool(ctx context.Context, tool *core.ServiceInfo, capability core.Capability, userRequest string) error {
    payload, err := a.generatePayload(ctx, userRequest, capability)

    // Validate in dev/staging, skip in prod for performance
    if os.Getenv("ENV") != "production" {
        os.Setenv("GOMIND_VALIDATE_PAYLOADS", "true")
    }

    // ... rest of logic
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: AI Generates Wrong Field Names

**Symptom:**
```json
// Tool expects: {"location": "London"}
// AI generates: {"city": "London"}
```

**Solution:** Add Phase 2 field hints:
```go
InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
    RequiredFields: []core.FieldHint{
        {Name: "location", Type: "string", Example: "London"},
    },
}
```

### Issue 2: Schema Cache Always Misses

**Symptom:**
```
Schema cache miss count increasing, hit rate < 20%
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Redis connection issues** - Check Redis connectivity
2. **Different tool/capability names** - Ensure consistent naming
3. **Cache TTL too short** - Increase TTL

**Solution:**
```go
// Check Redis connection
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
defer cancel()
if err := redisClient.Ping(ctx).Err(); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Redis connection failed: %v", err)
}

// Increase TTL
agent.SchemaCache = core.NewSchemaCache(redisClient,
    core.WithTTL(24 * time.Hour),
)

// Check cache stats
stats := agent.SchemaCache.Stats()
log.Printf("Cache stats: %+v", stats)
```

### Issue 3: Validation Fails for Valid Payloads

**Symptom:**
```
Payload validation failed: unexpected field: temperature_unit
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Schema too strict** - Doesn't allow valid fields
2. **Field name mismatch** - AI uses different name than schema expects

**Solution:**
```go
// Option 1: Fix schema to allow field
schema["additionalProperties"] = true

// Option 2: Add field to Phase 2 hints
InputSummary: &core.SchemaSummary{
    OptionalFields: []core.FieldHint{
        {Name: "temperature_unit", Type: "string", Example: "celsius"},
    },
}
```

### Issue 4: AI Response Contains Markdown

**Symptom:**
```
Failed to parse AI payload: invalid character '`'
Raw content: ```json\n{"location": "London"}\n```
```

**Solution:** Strip markdown code blocks:
```go
content := strings.TrimSpace(response.Content)

// Strip ```json ... ``` or ``` ... ```
if strings.HasPrefix(content, "```") {
    lines := strings.Split(content, "\n")
    if len(lines) >= 3 {
        startIdx := 1
        endIdx := len(lines) - 1
        for i := len(lines) - 1; i >= startIdx; i-- {
            if strings.HasPrefix(strings.TrimSpace(lines[i]), "```") {
                endIdx = i
                break
            }
        }
        if endIdx > startIdx {
            content = strings.Join(lines[startIdx:endIdx], "\n")
        }
    }
}

var payload map[string]interface{}
json.Unmarshal([]byte(content), &payload)
```

### Issue 5: Schema Fetch Timeout

**Symptom:**
```
Schema fetch failed: context deadline exceeded
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Tool not responding** - Tool down or slow
2. **Network issues** - K8s DNS or connectivity problems
3. **Timeout too short** - Tool takes longer than expected

**Solution:**
```go
// Increase timeout
httpCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 10*time.Second)  // Was 5s
defer cancel()

// Add retry logic
var schema map[string]interface{}
err := retry.Do(
    func() error {
        return fetchSchema(ctx, tool, capability)
    },
    retry.Attempts(3),
    retry.Delay(1*time.Second),
)

// Fall back to proceeding without validation
if err != nil {
    agent.Logger.Warn("Schema fetch failed after retries, proceeding without validation")
    // Continue without Phase 3
}
```

## 📝 Summary

The 3-phase approach to AI-powered payload generation in GoMind provides a **progressive enhancement** strategy that balances accuracy, performance, and complexity.

### Quick Reference

| Phase | What It Does | When to Use | Accuracy | Overhead |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Descriptions guide AI | Always (required) | ~85-90% | 0ms |
| **Phase 2** | Field hints guide AI | Production (recommended) | ~95% | 0ms |
| **Phase 3** | Schema validates payloads | High-reliability (optional) | ~99% | ~5ms first call, 0ms after |

### The Progressive Path

```
Start Here → Phase 1 (Descriptions)
  ↓
Add accuracy → Phase 2 (Field Hints)
  ↓
Add validation → Phase 3 (Schema Validation)
```

### Key Takeaways

1. **Phase 1 is required** - Every tool needs a clear description
2. **Phase 2 is recommended** - 95% accuracy for production tools
3. **Phase 3 is optional** - Add validation only where critical
4. **They stack together** - Each phase enhances the previous
5. **AI is the bottleneck** - Schema operations add negligible latency (~5ms)
6. **Cache is shared** - All agent replicas share Redis schema cache
7. **Graceful degradation** - System works even without Redis or validation

### Real-World Usage

```
Prototypes: Phase 1 only
  ↓
Production (most): Phase 1 + 2
  ↓
Mission-critical: Phase 1 + 2 + 3
```

### Next Steps
